# Part 1:   Measures of central tendency 	&  Measures of spread for quantitative data	

#### Here is the formula for the sample mean:
  
  $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$
  
#### And here is the formula for the sample standard deviation:
  
  $s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$
  
  
## 1.1 Five-Number Summary

####  Practice 1.1
Here are  costs of 10 electric smoothtop ranges rated very good or excelent by consumer report on their website www.consumerreports.org
$ 850, 900, 1400, 1200, 1050, 1000, 750, 1250, 1050, 565

  
* Calculate the sample mean
* Calculate the sample median
* Find the 5-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum)
* Check your work using R functions 
  
  
  
  
# 1.2 Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation by Hand

#### Practice 1.2 

Using the above data,complete the table for calculating the sample standard deviation.

# Part 2:  Graphing the shape of quantitative data (histograms and outliers)

Consider the data from the previous exercises. Using R, create a histogram of the data. What would you consider to be the shape of the distribution? Do you consider any of the data points to be potential outliers?
  
  
## 2.1 Classifying shapes of distributions
  
Generate histograms for each of the following data sets. Use the `$` command to access the individual data sets.

*Do you see any potential outliers? 
*Also calculate the five-number summary for each using R.

```{r}
set.seed(999)
s2_data = data.frame(
  dat1 = -rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat2 = rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat3 = runif(1000),
  dat4 = rnorm(1000),
  dat5 = sample(c(rnorm(1000, mean = 2), rnorm(1000, mean = 10)), size = 1000)
)
```

# Part 3:  Z-Scores and Percentiles  

## 3.1 Z-Scores 

Read the following description on Z-scores, then answer the question below.

## 3.2  Percentiles

Compute the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for the 5 data sets in the `s2_data` data.frame. Which has the smallest median? Which as the largest?
