## 1.1 Calculating Sample Mean and Standard Deviation by Hand

#### Here is the formula for the sample mean:

\[\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i\]

#### And here is the formula for the sample standard deviation:

\[s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}\]

#### Using these formulas, complete the following exercise:

Using the above data, perform the following calculations:

* Calculate the sample mean
* Calculate the sample median
* Calculate the sample standard deviation
* Find the 5-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum)
