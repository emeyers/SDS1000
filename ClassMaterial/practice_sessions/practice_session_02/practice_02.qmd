# Part 1 : Measures of central tendency 	&  Measures of spread for quantitative data	


## 1.1 Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation by Hand


#### Here is the formula for the sample mean:

$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$


#### And here is the formula for the sample standard deviation:

$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$


#### Using the above data, perform the following calculations. Complete the table
for calculating the sample standard deviation.

## 1.2 Five-Number Summary

Using the numbers from the previous exercise, do the following:

* Find the 5-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum)
* Check your work using R functions 

```{r}
# your code here
```


$\\$


## 1.2 Boxplots

Consider the `mtcars` data set. This data is built into R, so you can access it directly; no downloads required! First, create a histogram of the variable `mpg`. Then create a boxplot of `mpg`. 

1. How do these two plots compare? 

2. Create a boxplots of `mpg` per number of cylinders `cyl`.



```{r}
# your code here
```


$\\$


## 1.3 Quantitative data : histograms and outliers

Generate histograms for each of the following data sets. Use the `$` command to access the individual data sets. For each histogram, add the mean to the plot using `abline()`. Do you see any potential outliers? Also calculate the five-number summary for each using R.

```{r}
set.seed(999)
s2_data = data.frame(
  dat1 = -rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat2 = rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat3 = runif(1000),
  dat4 = rnorm(1000),
  dat5 = sample(c(rnorm(1000, mean = 2), rnorm(1000, mean = 10)), size = 1000)
)
```


$\\$


## 1.4  Percentiles

Compute the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for the 5 data sets in the `s2_data` data.frame. Which has the smallest median? Which as the largest?

```{r}
## your code here 
```
 

$\\$



## 1.5  Normal Distribution and +/- 2 Standard Deviations

The normal distribution (also known as the "bell-curve") occurs very frequently in mathematics, statistics, and the natural and social sciences. Which of the 5 data sets in the `s2_data` data.frame 
appears to be normally distributed?

Using this data set, find the mean and standard deviation, then calculate 2 standard deviations above, and 2 standard deviations below the mean. What percentiles do these values correspond to?



$\\$



## 1.6 Z-Scores

Read the following description on Z-scores, then answer the question below.

# Part 2 :  The Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables: Correlation and Regression 

$\\$


In this session you might use the formula of the correlation between two quantitative variables:


$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


$\\$

Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

* $\hat{y} = a + bx$, or 

* $\hat{\text{Response}} = a + b \cdot \text{(Explanatory)}$

* Residuals = observed - predicted = y - $\hat{y}$

Where: 

* Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

* Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
* a: is the y-intercept
  
* b: is the slope of the regression line

$\\$

 You may use the following R functions: `plot()`, `lm()`, `cor()`, `abline()`. And you might need to download Lock5Data using `library(Lock5Data)`. 


# Part 2:  Two quantitative variables/ Scatterplot and Correlation

## 2.1 Describe scatterplots

Here are several scatterplots. The calculated correlations are 0.006, - 0.977, - 0.487, and 0.777. Match each scatter plot with the appropriate correlation coeffecient.

**Answers:**

## 2.2 Create scatterplots in  R 


Load the data `FloridaLakes` from library(Lock5Data).

1. Describe the type of each of the variables: `pH`, `Calcium`, and `Alkalinity`. 

2. Create a three scatter plots for each pair of variables: pH` vs `Calcium`, pH`  vs  `Alkalinity`, and  `Calcium`  vs  `Alkalinity` . Add the main title to each plot.

3. What is the correlation coefficient between `pH` and  `Calcium`? Is it positive or negative?

4. What do these coefficients mean in the context of this data?

5. Try to calculate the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium` without using the `R` function for correlation.

  
**Answers:**

```{r}
# download the data and load it into R
library(Lock5Data)
data(FloridaLakes)


```
