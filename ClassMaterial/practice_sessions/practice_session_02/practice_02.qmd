# Part 1:   Measures of central tendency 	&  Measures of spread for quantitative data	

# Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation by Hand

#### Here is the formula for the sample mean:

$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$

#### And here is the formula for the sample standard deviation:

$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

#### 


Using the above data, perform the following calculations. Complete the table
for calculating the sample standard deviation.

# Five-Number Summary

Using the numbers from the previous exercise, do the following:

* Calculate the sample mean
* Calculate the sample median
* Find the 5-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum)
* Check your work using R functions 

# Graphing the shape of quantitative data: histograms and outliers

Consider the data from the previous exercises. Using R, create a histogram of the data. What would you consider to be the shape of the distribution? Do you consider any of the data points to be potential outliers?

# Classifying shapes of distributions

Generate histograms for each of the following data sets. Use the `$` command to access the individual data sets. For each histogram, add the mean to the plot using `abline()`. Do you see any potential outliers? Also calculate the five-number summary for each using R.

```{r}
set.seed(999)
s2_data = data.frame(
  dat1 = -rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat2 = rchisq(1000, df = 1),
  dat3 = runif(1000),
  dat4 = rnorm(1000),
  dat5 = sample(c(rnorm(1000, mean = 2), rnorm(1000, mean = 10)), size = 1000)
)
```

# Z-Scores

Read the following description on Z-scores, then answer the question below.

# Percentiles

Compute the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for the 5 data sets in the `s2_data` data.frame. Which has the smallest median? Which as the largest?

# Normal Distribution and +/- 2 Standard Deviations

The normal distribution (also known as the "bell-curve") occurs very frequently in mathematics, statistics, and the natural and social sciences. Which of the 5 data sets in the `s2_data` data.frame appears to be normally distributed?

Using this data set, find the mean and standard deviation, then calculate 2 standard deviations above, and 2 standard deviations below the mean. What percentiles do these values correspond to?

# Boxplots

Consider the `mtcars` data set. This data is built into R, so you can access it directly; no downloads required! First, create a histogram of the variable `mpg`. Then create a boxplot of `mpg`. How do these two plots compare?
