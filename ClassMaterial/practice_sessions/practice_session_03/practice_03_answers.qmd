# The Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables: Correlation and Regression 

$\\$

In this session you might use the formula of the correlation between two quantitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$

$\\$

Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

* $\hat{y}=a+bx$ , or 

* $\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

* Residuals= observed- predicted 

Where: 

* Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

* Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
* a: is the y- intercept
  
* b: is the slope of the regression line

$\\$

 You may use the following R functions: `plot()`, `lm()`, `cor()`, `abline()`. And you might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ). 


## Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation

**Practice 1:** 

Here are several scatter plots. The calculated correlations are 0.006, - 0.977, - 0.487, and 0.777. Match each scatter plot with the appropriate correlation coefficient

**Answers:**

a.  0.006

b.  0.777

c.  - 0.977

d.  - 0.487


$\\$

**Practice 2:**

Load the data of `FloridaLakes` from the library of lock5Data. 

1. Describe the type of each of the variables `pH` and `Calcium`, `Alkalinity`. 


2. Create a three scatter plots for each pair of variables: pH`  vs  `Calcium` ,`pH` vs `Alkalinity` , and  `Calcium` vs `Alkalinity` . Add the main title to each plot.

3. What is the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium`. Is it positive or negative.

4. What do these coefficients mean in the context of this data.

5. Try to calculate the correlation coefficient between pH and Calcium without using `R` function.

  
**Answers:**

```{r}
# download the data and load it into R
library(Lock5Data)
data(FloridaLakes)

# Describe the structure of the variables of FloridaLake
#str(FloridaLakes)
```

1.  Describe the type of each of the variables `pH` and `Calcium`, `Alkalinity`.

The variables `pH` and `Calcium`, `Alkalinity` are quantitative variables (continuous)



2.Create a scatter plots for each of the pair of variables ( add the main title of the plot).

```{r}
# Create scatter pH vs  Calcium 
par(mfrow= c(1,3))

plot(FloridaLakes$pH, 
     FloridaLakes$Calcium,
     main = "ph vs Calcium Scatter plot") 

# Create scatter plot pH vs  Alkalinity  

plot(FloridaLakes$pH, 
     FloridaLakes$Alkalinity ,
     main = "ph vs Alkalinity Scatter plot")

# Create scatter plot Calcium vs  Alkalinity  

plot(FloridaLakes$Calcium, FloridaLakes$Alkalinity,
    main = "Calcium vs Alkalinity Scatter plot")

```


3. What is the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium`. Is it positive or negative.

```{r}

# correlation

cor_pH_Cal <- cor(FloridaLakes$pH, FloridaLakes$Calcium) 

cor_pH_Alk <- cor(FloridaLakes$pH, FloridaLakes$Alkalinity)

cor_Cal_Alk <- cor(FloridaLakes$Calcium, FloridaLakes$Alkalinity)

cor_pH_Cal
cor_pH_Alk 
cor_Cal_Alk

```

4.  What do these coefficients mean in the context of this data.

A correlation coefficient of 0.577  between `pH`and `Calcium` means that there is a linear positive association of moderate strength of 0.577.



5.calculate the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium`  without using `R` function.

```{r}
## Method 2 to calculate the correlation using the formula 

n<- length(FloridaLakes$pH)

X<-FloridaLakes$pH

Y<- FloridaLakes$Calcium


cor_pH_Cal<- sum((X - mean(X))*(Y-mean(Y)))*(1/(n - 1))*1/sd(X)*1/sd(Y)

cor_pH_Cal

```

## Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 


**Practice 3:**


State if the following sentences are true or false.

a. We choose the linear model that passes through the most data points on scatter plot.

b. The residuals are observed y-values minus the y-value predicted by linear model.

c. Least square means that the square of the largest residuals is as small as it could be possibly be.

d. Some of the residuals from least linear model will be positive and some will be negative.

e. Least squares means that some of the squares of the residuals are minimized.

f. We write $\hat{y}$ to denote the predicted values and the y to denote the observed value.


**Answers:**

a.  False; we choose a model that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (i.e., sum of squared distances between each point and the regression line).


b.  True; this is the definition of a residual.


c.  False; the least squares method minimizes the **total** sum of squared distances, not the largest squared distance. It takes into account all observations, not a single observation.


d.  True; we see this from the residual plot normally; some values are above 0, others are below.

e. False; the least squares method minimizes the **total** sum of squared distances. The least squares method does not minimize individual squared 


f. True; this is the definition of $y$ and $\hat y$ in regression.

$\\$

**Practice 4:** 

Use the previous data `FloridaLakes` and the two variables `Alkalinity`  and  `calcium`.

1. Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict `Alkalinity` from `calcium`.

2. Find the coefficients of the regression and write the correct equation of this linear model.

3. Interpret the intercept and slope of the model within the context of the data.

4. Predict the `Alkalinity` level when  Calcium = 2.5.

5. The actual `Alkalinity` level was 8.5 when  Calcium = 2.5. Find the residual for this data point.

6. Find the five number summary for the variable `Calcium`.

7. Predict the `Alkalinity` level when  Calcium = 0.5

8. Do both of these predictions make sense given the data?

**Answers:**

1. Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict  `calcium` from `pH`.

```{r}
 
# Fit a linear regression model data and add the regression line to the plot

Calcium_Alk_fit <- lm( FloridaLakes$Alkalinity ~ FloridaLakes$Calcium)


# Add the regression line to the plot
abline(Calcium_Alk_fit, col = "green")

```

2. Find the coefficients of the regression and write the correct  equation of this linear model.
  
after running the following code you will get the intercept and the slope values of the regression line equation as follows :

$\hat{Alkalinity} = 9.206 + 1.276  \cdot Calcium$.

```{r}
# you can use one of the following methods:

## method 1 

print(Calcium_Alk_fit )

## or method 2 

reg_coef<-coef(Calcium_Alk_fit) 
reg_coef

```

3. Interpret the intercept and slope of the model within the context of the data.

"Slope": for each increase of "one" unit in the calcium level there will be an increase of "1.276" in the Alkalinity level. 

"Intercept": when calcium level is set to "0" the Alkalinity level will be 9.206


4. Predict the `Alkalinity` level when  Calcium = 2.5.

```{r}

# predict Alkalinity when calcium= 2.5 

## method 1 
(predicted_Alk_2.6 <- reg_coef[1] + reg_coef[2] * 2.5)


## method 2 
(predicted_Alk_0.5 <- 9.206 + 1.276 * 2.5)

## method 3 : using the function `predict` and the data 39 corresponding to calcium= 2.5

(predicted_Alk_2.5 <- predict(Calcium_Alk_fit)[39])

```


5. The actual `Alkalinity` level was 8.5 when Calcium=2.5. Find the residual for this data point.

```{r}
# residuals  when Calcium =2.5

## method 1:
 (res_2.5<-  8.5 - predict(Calcium_Alk_fit)[39] )


# method 2: residual=observed[data39]-predicted[data 39]
(res_2.5<- FloridaLakes$Alkalinity[39]- predict(Calcium_Alk_fit)[39] )


# method 3: 
(res_2.5<- Calcium_Alk_fit$residuals[39]) 

```


6. Find the five number summary for the variable `Calcium`.

```{r}

fivenum(FloridaLakes$Calcium)

```


7. Predict the `Alkalinity` level when  Calcium = 0.5

```{r}

(predicted_Alk_0.5 <- reg_coef[1] + reg_coef[2] * 0.5)
```


8. Do both of these predictions make sense given the data?

The level of Calcium = 2.5 is within the range of the data. But the Level of Calcium= 0.5 id an extrapolation.

## Part 3:  Review

**Practive 5:**

From the data `ICUAdmissions` create descriptive statistics ( such as: `boxplot`, `histogram`, `five number summary` ) for the variables
 `Infection`, `Age`, `Race`, `HeartRate`.


**Answers:**

```{r}
# download the data and load it into R
library(Lock5Data)
data(ICUAdmissions)

#str(ICUAdmissions)
```

#  It seems that the variables types are: 
* Age : quantitative variable

* Infection: Categorical variable

* Race : Categorical variable

* HeartRate: Quantitative variable

# Descriptive stats for " one quantitative variable" 

we can describe a quantitative variable with : ` histogram` `five number summary`, `boxplot`

```{r}

hist(ICUAdmissions$HeartRate)

boxplot(ICUAdmissions$HeartRate)

fivenum(ICUAdmissions$Age)

```


# Descriptive stats for " one categorical variable":

we can describe a categorical variable with : ` bar plot` , ` table`

```{r}
#one categorical variable

## one way table ( Infection)
Infection_table<- table(ICUAdmissions$Infection)
Infection_table

barplot(Infection_table)

## one way table proportions 
(proportions<- prop.table(inf_table))

```
# Descriptive stats for " two categorical variable":

```{r}
# two categorical variable (Infection and Race) 

## two way frequency table 
(inf_race_table<- table(ICUAdmissions$Infection, ICUAdmissions$Race ))


## two way table proportions 
(proportions<- prop.table(inf_race_table))

```


# Descriptive stats for " two quantitative variable" :
we can describe two quantitative variable with:
`scatter plot` , `correlation`

```{r}
# scatter plot
plot(ICUAdmissions$Age, ICUAdmissions$HeartRate)


# correlation
cor(ICUAdmissions$Age, ICUAdmissions$HeartRate)

```

# Descriptive stats for " one quantitative variable vs one categorical variable" :

we can describe them with `boxpot`

```{r}
# boxplot of age( quantitative) versus categorical variable: Infection( which has two levels )

boxplot(ICUAdmissions$Age ~ ICUAdmissions$Infection)

```
