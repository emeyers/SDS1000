# The Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables: Correlation and Regression 






* In this session you might use the formula of the correlation bewtween two quatitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


* Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

** $\hat{y}=a+bx$ , or 

** $\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

Where: 

  *** Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

  *** Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
  *** a: is the y- intercept
  
  *** b: is the slope of the regression line

  
  * You may use the following R functions: `plot()`, `lm()`, `cor()`, `abline()`. And you might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ).

**Practice 2:**


Load the data of " FloridaLakes" from the library of lock5Data. 

1. Describe the type of each of the variables "pH" and "Calcium", "Alkalinity". 

2. Create a scatter plot each two variables and describe it. Add a line to the scatter plot using "abline()" function.  

3. What is the correlation coefficient between "pH" and "Calcium". Is it positive or negative.

## Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 



**Practice 4:** 

Use the previous data " FloridaLakes" and the two variables "pH" and " calcium.

1. Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict " calcium" from "pH".

2. Write the correct regression equation of this linear model.

3. Interpret the intercept, the slop, and  $R^2 of the model within the context of the data

4. Find the five number  of the "pH".

5. Predict the calcium level when:    pH= 2.6,  pH= 5.3 , pH= 9.7

6. Which prediction is valid and which one is an "extrapolation" .

7. Find the residuals for each of the previous predictions.


**Answers:**

## Part 3:  Review

**Practive 5:**

From the data " ICUAdmissions",study the following variables by creating descriptive statistics such as: boxplot, histogram, five number summary:
 " Infection", " Age", " Race".
