# Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation
# Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 
# Part 3:  Review

### 

i) In this session you might use the formula of the correlation bewtween two quatitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


ii) Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

$\hat{y}=a+bx$

$\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

Where: 

  ** Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

  ** Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
  ** a: is the y- intercept
  
  ** b: is the slope of the regression line
  
  iii) You may use the following R functions: plot(), lm(), cor(), abline(). And you might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ). 

  
## Practice 1:

## Practice 2:

Load the data of " Floridalakes" from the library of lock5Data. 

- Describe the type of each of the variables "ph" and "Calcium". 

- Create a scatter plot of the two variables and describe it. 

- What is the correlation coefficient between "ph" and "Calcium". Is it positive or negative, and what this coefficient means in the context of this data.

- What is the correlation coefficient between "Calcium" "ph".

## Practice 4: 
use abline in the data

Use the previous data " FloridaLakes" and the two variables "hp" and " calcium.

1)- Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict " calcium" from "hp".

2)- Write the correct regresion equation of this linear model.

3)- Interpret the intercept, the slop, and  $R^2of the model within the context of the data

4)- Find the five num of the "hp".

5)- Prodict the calcium level when   hp= .., and hp= , hp=

..   . 
6)- Which prediction is valid and which one is an "extrapolation" .

7)- find the residuals for each of the previous predictions.
