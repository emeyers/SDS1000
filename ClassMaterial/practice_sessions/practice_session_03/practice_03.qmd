# The Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables: Correlation and Regression 

$\\$




In this session you might use the formula of the correlation between two quantitative variables:


$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


$\\$

Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

* $\hat{y} = a + bx$, or 


* $\hat{\text{Response}} = a + b \cdot \text{(Explanatory)}$

* Residuals = observed - predicted = y - $\hat{y}$

Where: 

* Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

* Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
* a: is the y-intercept
  
* b: is the slope of the regression line

 You may use the following R functions: `plot()`, `lm()`, `cor()`, `abline()`. And you might need to download Lock5Data using `library(Lock5Data)`. 





## Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation

**Practice 1:** 

Here are several scatterplots. The calculated correlations are 0.006, - 0.977, - 0.487, and 0.777. Match each scatter plot with the appropriate correlation coeffecient.

**Practice 2:**


Load the data `FloridaLakes` from library(Lock5Data).

1. Describe the type of each of the variables: `pH`, `Calcium`, and `Alkalinity`. 

2. Create a scatter plots for each of pair of variables. Add the main title to the plots.

3. What is the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium`? Is it positive or negative?

4. What do these coefficients mean in the context of this data?

5. Try to calculate the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium` without using the `R` function for correlation.

  
**Answers:**

```{r}
# download the data and load it into R
library(Lock5Data)
data(FloridaLakes)

## Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 


**Practice 3:**


State if the following sentences are true or false:

a. We choose the linear model that passes through the most data points on a scatterplot.

b. The residuals are observed y-values minus the y-value predicted by a linear model.

c. Least square means that the square of the largestt residuas is as small as it could possibly be.

d. Some of the residuals from least linear model will be positive, and some will be negative.

e. Least squares means that some of the squares of the residuals are minimized.

f. We write $\hat{y}$ to denote the predicted value, and y to denote the observed value.


**Answers:**

a.


b.


c.


d.


e.


f.

**Practice 4:** 


Use the previous data `FloridaLakes` and the variables `calcium` and `Alkalinity`. 

1. Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict `Alkalinity` from `calcium`.

2. Find the coefficients of the regression and write the correct equation of this linear model.

3. Interpret the intercept and slope of the model within the context of the data.

4. Find the five number summary for the variable `Calcium`.

5. Predict the `Alkalinity` level when Calcium = 0.5 and when Calcium = 2.6.

6. Do both of these predictions make sense given the data?

7. Find the residuals for each of the previous predictions.

## Part 3:  Review

**Practive 5:**

From the data `ICUAdmissions` create descriptive statistics and visualizations for the variables `Infection`, `Age`, and `Race`, `HeartRate`.


**Answers:**

```{r}
# download the data and load it into R
library(Lock5Data)
data(ICUAdmissions)



```
