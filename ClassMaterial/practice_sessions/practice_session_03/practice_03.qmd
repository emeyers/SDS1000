# Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation
# Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 
# Part 3:  Review

### 

i) In this session you might use the formula of the correlation bewtween two quatitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


ii) Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

$\hat{y}=a+bx$

$\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

Where: 

  ** Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

  ** Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
  ** a: is the y- intercept
  
  ** b: is the slope of the regression line
  
  iii) You may use the following R functions: plot(), lm(), cor(), abline(). And you
  might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ).

## Practice 2:

Load the data of " Floridalakes" from the library of lock5Data. 

- Describe the type of each of the variables "ph" and "Calcium". 

- Create a scatter plot of the two variables and describe it. 

- What is the correlation coefficient between "ph" and "Calcium". Is it positive or negative, and what it means in the context.

- What is the correlation coefficient between "Calcium" "ph".
