# Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation
# Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 
# Part 3:  Review


i) In this session you might use the formula of the correlation bewtween two quatitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


ii) Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

$\hat{y}=a+bx$

$\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

Where: 

  ** Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

  ** Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
  ** a: is the y- intercept
  
  ** b: is the slope of the regression line
  
  iii) You may use the following R functions: plot(), lm(), cor(), abline(). And you might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ).

## Practice 2:

Load the data of " FloridaLakes" from the library of lock5Data. 

- Describe the type of each of the variables "pH" and "Calcium", "Alkalinity". 

- Create a scatter plot each two variables and describe it. Add a line to the scatter plot using "abline()" function.  

- What is the correlation coefficient between "pH" and "Calcium". Is it positive or negative.

- What this coefficient means in the context of this data.

# Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 
## Practice 4: 

Use the previous data " FloridaLakes" and the two variables "pH" and " calcium.

1)- Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict " calcium" from "pH".

2)- Write the correct regression equation of this linear model.

3)- Interpret the intercept, the slop, and  $R^2 of the model within the context of the data

4)- Find the five number  of the "pH".

5)- Predict the calcium level when:    pH= 2.6,  pH= 5.3 , pH= 9.7

6)- Which prediction is valid and which one is an "extrapolation" .

7)- Find the residuals for each of the previous predictions.



# Part 3:  Review

## Practive 5 (A Review):

From the data " ICUAdmissions",study the following variables by creating descriptive statistics such as: boxplot, histogram, five number summary:
 " Infection", " Age", " Race".
