# The Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables: Correlation and Regression 






* In this session you might use the formula of the correlation bewtween two quatitative variables:

$r_{x y}=\frac{1}{(n-1) s_z s_y} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_i-\bar{y}\right)$


* Remember that the fitted regression line is defined by the equation: 

** $\hat{y}=a+bx$ , or 

** $\hat{Response}= a + b ( Explanatory)$

Where: 

  *** Response: is the response variable or the dependent variable

  *** Explanatory: is the independent variable
  
  *** a: is the y- intercept
  
  *** b: is the slope of the regression line

  
  * You may use the following R functions: `plot()`, `lm()`, `cor()`, `abline()`. And you might need to download Lock5Data using Library(Lock5Data ). 





## Part 1:  Two quantitative variables: Scatterplot and Correlation

**Practice 1:** 

Here are several scatterplots. The calculated correlations are 0.006, - 0.977, - 0.487, and 0.777. Match each scatter plot with the appropriate correlation coeffecient

**Practice 2:**


Load the data of `FloridaLakes` from the library of lock5Data. 

1. Describe the type of each of the variables `pH` and `Calcium`, `Alkalinity`. 

2. Create a scatter plot each two variables and describe it. Add a line to the scatter plot using "abline()" function.  

3. What is the correlation coefficient between `pH` and `Calcium`. Is it positive or negative.

4. What this coefficient means in the context of this data.

## Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 


**Practice 3:**


State if the following sentences are true or false.

a. We choose the linear model that passes through the most data points on scatterplot.

b. The residuals are observed y-values minus the y-value predicted by linear model.

c. Least square means that the square of the largerst residuals is as small as it could be possibly be.

d. Some of the residuals from least linear model will be positive and some will be negative.

e. Least squares means that some of the squares of the residuals are minimized.

f. We write $\hat{y}$ to denote the predicted values and the y to denote the observed value.

## Part 2:  Two quantitative variables: Linear Regression 



**Practice 4:** 

Use the previous data `FloridaLakes` and the two variables `pH` and `calcium`.

1. Using the appropriate R function, create a linear model to predict `calcium` from `pH`.

2. Write the correct regression equation of this linear model.

3. Interpret the intercept, the slop, and  $R^2 of the model within the context of the data

4. Find the five number  of the `pH`.

5. Predict the calcium level when:    pH= 2.6,  pH= 5.3 , pH= 9.7

6. Which prediction is valid and which one is an extrapolation .

7. Find the residuals for each of the previous predictions.

## Part 3:  Review

**Practive 5:**

From the data `ICUAdmissions` create descriptive statistics ( such as: `boxplot`, `histogram`, `five number summary` ) for the variables
 `Infection`, `Age`, `Race`.
