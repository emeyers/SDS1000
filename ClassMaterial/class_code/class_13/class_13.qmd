## Part 1: Lie detector hypothesis test

A study by Hollien, Harnsberger, Martin and Hollien (2010) tried to assess the 
accuracy of lie detection software. 

A sample of 48 participants were gather and attached to a lie detection device. 
They were asked to read deceptive (lying) material out loud. 

The lie detector correctly reported that 31 out of the 48 participants were lying. 

Let's run a hypothesis test to see if the results provide evidence that lie 
detectors are more than 60% accurate?

### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

### Step 3: create the null distribution



```{r lie_detector_null_distribution}


library(SDS1000)



# create the null distribution






# plot the null distribution





# add a red vertical line at the observed statistic





```

**Question**: What would have happened if we had tested whether lie detector 
tests get it correct more than 50% of the time? 

Try it!

## Part 2: Two-sided hypothesis tests

Let's say we want to test whether the lie detector is different from 60% accurate.

### Step 4: calculate the p-value


```{r lie_detector_p_value_2sided}

# create the margin between the observed statistic and the null hypothesis parameter value

## Part 3: Hypothesis tests for two means


A randomized controlled trial by Lyle et al (1987) investigated whether calcium
lowered blood pressure.

 - A treatment group of 10 men received a calcium supplement for 12 weeks.  
 - A control group of 11 men received a placebo during the same period.  

The blood pressure of these men was taken before and after the 12 weeks of the study.

Let's run a hypothesis test to see if there was a larger decrease in blood
pressure for participants that received calcium compared to those that received
a placebo.
