# Part 1: Warm-up problems


Let's start by doing a couple of warm-up problems doing inferences on means. 



$\\$



## Warm-up 1: Parametric hypothesis test for a single mean


It is recommended that adults sleep at least 8 hours a night.

A Statistics professor asked 12 undergraduate students how much sleep they were
getting and found the average was 6.2 hours with a standard deviation of 1.7
hours.

Assuming this sample is representative of all students in a Statistics class
(and that the data is reasonably normal) does this provide evidence that
students in the class are not getting enough sleep on average?

Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses


In words: 

- Null hypothesis: 
- Alternative hypothesis: 


In symbols:  





```{r hypothesis_test_mean}



# Step 2: Calculate the t-statistic

n <- 12
x_bar <- 6.2
s <- 1.7
mu_0 <- 8







# Step 3: Visualize the null distribution








# Step 4: Calculate the p-value







```



Step 5: Make a decision

## Warm-up 2: Confidence interval for the difference of two means

A study by Nierenberg et al (1989) investigated the relationship between dietary
factors, and plasma concentrations of carotenoids.

Let’s use the data they collected, but this time let's create a 95% confidence
interval for the differences in the number of grams of fiber eaten in a day
between males and females.


$$CI ~ = ~ (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) ~ \pm ~ t^* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

```{r confidence_interval_difference_means}


# Given data
nutrition_df <- read.csv("NutritionStudy.csv")

fiber_males  <- subset(nutrition_df, Sex == "Male")$Fiber
fiber_females <- subset(nutrition_df, Sex == "Female")$Fiber




# Get basic descriptive statistics for males


          

# Get basic descriptive statistics for females

            


# Degrees of freedom (using the smaller of n1-1 and n2-1)


# Calculate the standard error (SE)



# Find the critical t-value for the desired confidence level



# Calculate the margin of error (ME)




# Construct the confidence interval




```


Question: Does it seem that there is a difference in the amount of fiber males
and females eat in a day?


Answer: 







$\\$







# Part 2: Inferences for a difference of proportions


The table below gives the flight arrival numbers from a random sample of flights
for two airlines. Let’s run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is a
difference between the two airlines in the percent of flights that arrive late.

| Airline   | Early | On-time | Late  | Total |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Airline A |  133  |   416   |  151  |  700  |
| Airline B |   58  |   355   |  87   |  500  |
| Total     |  191  |   771   |  238  | 1200  |


Using a t-statistic could be helpful here:

$$t ~ = ~ \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n_2}}}$$

where $\hat{p}$ is the pooled proportion of late flights. 




$\\$


Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses

In words:

- Null hypothesis: 
  
- Alternative hypothesis: 



In symbols:





```{r hypothesis_test_difference_proportions}


# Given data
late_A <- 151
total_A <- 700
late_B <- 87
total_B <- 500


# Step 2: Calculate the t-statistic

# Sample proportions



# Pooled proportion



# Standard error



# T-statistic




# Step 3: Visualize the null distribution









# Step 4: Calculate the p-value






```

# Part 3: Hypothesis test for multiple proportions using randomization methods


A Yale professor was interesting in examining whether Yale students were equally
likely to be born in each month. To test this he gathered data on the birth
months of 198 randomly selected Yale students. The data is loaded in the R chunk
below.

Please help him test whether the birth months are uniformly distributed across
the 12 months of the year using randomization methods to create the null 
distribution.



$\\$



Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses







```{r chi_squared_test_multiple_proportions}

library(SDS1000)

yale_births <- read.csv("yale_birth_data.csv")
birth_months <- yale_births$birth_month



# Observed counts



# Expected counts (assuming uniform distribution)




# Step 2: Calculate the chi-squared test statistic

# Calculate the chi-squared test statistic





# Step 3: Create a null distribution using randomization methods





# Visualize the null distribution






# Step 4: Calculate the p-value





```



Step 5: Make a decision





$\\$





# Part 4: Chi-squared test for comparing multiple proportions 

Let's rerun the hypothesis test from Part 3, but this time using a parametric
chi-squared test.

Our null and alternative hypotheses are the same as in Part 3. So is the observed
statistic we calculated earlier. So let's jump in at step 3 and start by 
visualizing the null distribution, and then go from there...



```{r chi_squared_test_multiple_proportions_parametric}


# reminder of our chi-squared statistic




# Step 3: Visualize the null distribution

# Degrees of freedom








# Step 4: Calculate the p-value





```



Step 5: Make a decision

# Part 5: Jury selection in Alameda county 

Section 197 of California's Code of Civil Procedure says: 

"All persons selected for jury service shall be selected at random, from a
source or sources inclusive of a representative cross section of the population
of the area served by the court."


In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California
presented a report that concluded that certain racial and ethnic groups are
underrepresented among jury panelists in Alameda County.

The table below summarizes the ACLU's findings, comparing the racial/ethnic
composition of the jury panelists to that of the eligible population from which
they were drawn, based on 1453 people who were on jury panels. 

| Group    | Asian | Black | Latino | White | Other |
|----------|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Eligible | 0.15  | 0.18  | 0.12   | 0.54  | 0.01  |
| Panel    | 0.26  | 0.08  | 0.08   | 0.54  | 0.04  |


Using a chi-squared test, assess whether there is evidence that the
racial/ethnic composition of the jury panelists differs from that of the
eligible population.


```{r chi_squared_test_jury_selection}

# Given data
total_jury <- 1453
eligible_population <- c(.15, .08, .08, .54, .04) 
jury_panelists  <- c(.26, .18, .12, .54, .01) 


# Expected counts based on eligible population proportions
expected_counts <- eligible_population  * total_jury

# Observed counts
observed_counts <- jury_panelists * total_jury



# Step 2: Calculate the chi-squared test statistic





# Step 3: Visualize the null distribution







# Step 4: Calculate the p-value






```



Step 5: Make a decision
