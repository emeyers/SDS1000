## Example Quarto Document


This is an example of a Quarto document. Quarto enables you to weave together
content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto
see <https://quarto.org>.


All the class code that we use will be in Quarto documents and you will also use
Quarto documents for your homework.

## Text and LaTeX

Any text (outside an R chunk) will be rendered as regular text when you click
the **Render** button to convert your Quarto document into a pdf document. 

We can also include LaTeX symbols in our text sections using specific Markdown
syntax. For example, we can:

a. Create Greek letters such as: 

b. We can also put accents above characters such as: 




$\\$





## Running Code


We can include R code in our Quarto document using R chunks, such as the R chunk
shown below. When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated
that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code
like this:



```{r}





```
