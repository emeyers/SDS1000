**Exercise 1 (8 points)**: **Smiles and Leniency.**  An experiment was conducted 
by LeFrance and Hect to study the effects of smiling on leniency in judging
students accused of cheating. Participants in the experiment took on the role of
members of a college disciplinary panel judging students accused of cheating.
For each suspect, along with a description of the offense, a picture was
provided with either a smile or a neutral facial expression. A leniency score
was calculated based on the disciplinary decisions made by the participants. The
experimenters believed that the average leniency score would be higher for
smiling students ($\mu_s$) than the average for students who had neutral
expressions ($\mu_n$) .

Let’s examine the hypothesis that $H_0: \mu_s = \mu_n$  vs. $H_a: \mu_s > \mu_n$
and use data to test if there is evidence that average leniency score is higher
for smiling students ($\mu_s$) than for students with a neutral expressions
($\mu_n$ ). A dot plot for the difference in sample means based on 1,000 random
assignments of leniency scores from the original sample to smile and neutral
groups is shown in Figure 1.

a.	The difference in sample means for the original samples is $D = \bar{x}_s -
\bar{x}_n$ = 4.91 – 4.12 = 0.79 (as shown in Figure 4.20). What is the p-value
for the one-tailed test? Hint: There are 27 dots in the tail beyond 0.79.

b.	We can also consider the test with a two-tailed alternative, $H_0: \mu_s =
\mu_n$  vs. $H_a: \mu_s \ne \mu_n$, where we make no assumption in advance on
whether smiling helps or discourages leniency. How would the null distribution
in Figure 4.20 change for this test? How would the p-value change?

**Exercise 2**: **Effect of Sleep and Caffeine on Memory**  

The consumption of caffeine to benefit alertness is a common activity practiced
by 90% of adults in North America. Often caffeine is used in order to replace
the need for sleep. 

One recent study compares students’ ability to recall memorized information
after either the consumption of caffeine or a brief sleep. A random sample of 24
adults (between the ages of 18 and 39) were randomly divided into two groups and
verbally given a list of 24 words to memorize. During a break, one of the groups
takes a nap for an hour and a half, and another group is kept awake and then
given a caffeine pill an hour prior to the testing. The response variable of
interest is the number of words participants are able to recall following the
break.

Let's run a hypothesis assess whether there is a difference in mean number of
words people can recall depending on whether they take a nap or take a caffeine
pill.



$\\$


**Exercise 2.1 (5 points)**:  Let's start our hypothesis test with step 1 by 
stating the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words. Also state the
significance level ($\alpha$) that is most commonly used in hypothesis tests
(i.e., if the p-value is less than $\alpha$, $H_0$ will be rejected).




**In words**





 
 

**In symbols**






**The significance level**







$\\$




**Exercise 2.2a (5 points)** The data from the study is given in the R chunk 
below. Let's visualize the data by creating a side-by-side boxplot comparing the
number of words recalled for the sleep and caffeine groups. In the answer
section, report whether it appears that the number of words recalled differ on
average depending on whether a person naps or takes a caffeine pill?


```{r visualize_sleep}

# The data from the study
sleep_condition <- c(14, 18, 11, 13, 18, 17, 21, 9, 16, 17, 14, 15)
caffeine_condition <- c(12, 12, 14, 13, 6, 18, 14, 16, 10, 7, 15, 10)


# Create the boxplot






```


**Answer:** 






$\\$





**Part 2.2b (4 points)**:  Now let's create the "observed statistic" which will 
be the difference in mean number of words recalled between the sleep and
caffeine groups. Please calculate this value and save it to an object called
`obs_stat`, and print it out to "show your work". Also, report the value of this
statistic below.

```{r sleep_obs_stat}






```

**Answer:** 





$\\$





**Exercise 2.3 (10 points)**: Next let's do step 3 of the hypothesis test by 
creating a null distribution. Please create the null distribution and save it to
an object called `null_dist`. Then plot the null distribution. 


```{r sleep_null_distribution}









```




$\\$



**Exercise 2.4 (8 points)**: Let's do step 4 of the hypothesis test by calculating
the p-value using the SDS1000 `pnull()` function. As always, please print out
this p-value in the chunk below to "show your work", and report what the p-value
is in the answer section.

```{r sleep_pvalue}






```


**Answers**

## Part 3: Hypothesis tests for more than two means


Are movies that have particular Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) 
ratings (i.e., G, PG, PG-13 or R) enjoyed more by movie critics? In the
exercises below we will run hypothesis tests to examine this question using data
from over 500 movies randomly selected from the [Rotten Tomatoes
website](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).




$\\$




**Exercise 3.0 (2 points)**:

The code below loads the movie data and creates two vectors. The first vector is
called `mpaa_rating` and has the MPAA rating for each movie (i.e., the vector
contains categorical data with the levels of: G, PG, PG-13, and R). The second
vector is called `critics_score` and contains ratings critics gave to movies on
a scale from 1 to 100. You will use these two vectors (`mpaa_rating` and
`critics_score`) to examine whether the average (mean) movie scores differ
depending on the rating MPAA rating level. If you are interested in learning
more about this full data set a codebook describing the variables can be found
on [this website](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.html).

To start your analysis, report the sample size *n* for these two vectors using
the `length()` function.



```{r get_rotten_tomatoes_data}

# load the data
load('movies.Rda')


# only keep movies rated "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R" (you can ignore this)
movies2 <- movies[movies$mpaa_rating %in% c("G", "PG", "PG-13", "R"), ]
movies2$mpaa_rating <- droplevels(movies2$mpaa_rating)


# get the MPAA ratings and the rotten tomatoes critic scores 
# you will only use these two vectors for the rest of these exercises
mpaa_rating <- movies2$mpaa_rating
critics_score <- movies2$critics_score


# display the sample size of the two vectors you will use in your analyses



```


**Answer** [report the sample size of these vectors]. 





$\\$






**Exercise 3.1 (5 points)**:  Let's now start our hypothesis test with step 1 
by stating the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words. Also state
the significance level ($\alpha$) that is most commonly used in hypothesis tests
(i.e., if the p-value is less than $\alpha$, $H_0$ will be rejected).




**In words**






**In symbols**







**The significance level**










$\\$




**Exercise 3.2a (5 points)** Let's now visualize the data by creating a 
side-by-side boxplot comparing the critics' scores of the movie for each MPAA
rating level. Does it appear that the critics' scores differ on average
depending on the MPAA classification of the movie?


```{r visualize_movies}





```


**Answer:** 







$\\$






**Part 3.2b (4 points)**:  Next let's use the MAD statistic that we discussed 
in class to compare the mean critic scores between the different MPAA rating
levels. To do this we can use the `get_MAD_stat(quantitative_data, grouping_data)` 
function from the SDS1000 library. Save the MAD statistic value to an object
called `obs_stat` and report the value of this statistic below.


```{r movies_obs_stat}


# Calculate the MAD statistic



```

**Answer:**  





$\\$





**Exercise 3.3 (10 points)**: Now let's do step 3 of the hypothesis test by creating 
a null distribution. Then plot the null distribution along with a red vertical
line at the real MAD statistic value. Based on looking at this null
distribution, what do you think the p-value is and does there appear to be a
difference between between the critics' scores depending on the MPAA rating?


```{r MAD_null_distribution}








```


**Answers** 







$\\$



**Exercise 3.4 (4 points)**: Let's do step 4 of the hypothesis test by calculating 
the p-value using the SDS1000 `pnull()` function. Report what the p-value is. Is
this close to what you estimated by looking at the null distribution above?

```{r p_value}





```


**Answers** 





$\\$




**Exercise 3.5 (4 points)**:  Now complete step 5 of hypothesis testing by making 
a judgment. Are you able to reject the null hypothesis? What do you conclude? 


**Answer**

## Part 4: Hypothesis tests for correlation - The 1969 draft lottery


In 1969, the United States Selective Service conducted a lottery to decide which
young men would be drafted into the armed forces. Each of the 366 birthdays in a
year (including February 29) was assigned a draft number. Young men born on days
that were assigned low draft numbers were drafted.

If the draft was completely fair, there should be no correlation between the
draft number and the date someone was born. In the following set of exercises we
will use hypothesis testing to assess whether there was indeed no correlation.

$\\$





**Exercise 4.1 (4 points)**: Let's start by doing step 1 of our null hypothesis 
significance tests (NHSTs) by stating the null and alternative hypotheses in
symbols and in words, and state the conventional significance level.


**Answer:** 











$\\$




**Part 4.2a (5 points)**: Now that we've stated the null and alternative hypothesis, 
let's visualize the data. The code below extracts two vectors that we can use to
assess whether there is a correlation between the dates some one was born on and
their draft number. In particular, the vector `sequential_date` contains the
numbers for the sequential dates of the year (i.e., January 1st is 1, January
2nd is 2, etc.), and the vector `draft_number` contains the draft number for
each sequential date. Using these two vectors, create a scatter plot of the
draft number as a function of the sequential date. Does there appear to be any
trend in the data?


```{r draft_data}

# load the data into R
load('draft_lottery_data.Rda')

sequential_date <- draft_lottery_data$Sequential_Date
draft_number <- draft_lottery_data$Draft_Number

# plot the data






```


**Answer:** 







$\\$






**Part 4.2b (4 points)**: Next let's do step 2 of hypothesis testing by calculating 
the statistic of interest and saving it to an object called `obs_stat`. Describe
what this statistic means as clearly as you can (e.g., if the statistic is
negative what does that mean in terms of dates and draft numbers?).


```{r draft_stat}





```



**Answer:** 








$\\$







**Part 4.3 (8 points)**: Now let's do step 3 of hypothesis testing by creating 
a null distribution. You can calculate one point in the null distribution by
shuffling the `draft_numbers` (using the SDS100 `shuffle()` function) and then
calculating the correlation. Use the `do_it()` to repeat this process 10,000
times to generate the full null distribution. Plot a histogram of the null
distribution, put a red vertical line on it at the value of the observed
statistic, and describe the null distribution's shape. Is the center of the null
distribution at a value that makes sense to you? Also, report what you expect
the p-value to be.



```{r draft_null}
 








```


**Answer:** 








$\\$






**Part 4.4 (7 points)**: Now use the `pnull()` function to calculate the p-value 
by seeing the proportion of points in the null distribution that are *as extreme
or more extreme* than the observed statistic. Is this p-value consistent with
there being no correlation between draft numbers and sequential dates?

```{r draft_pval}
    



    
    

```


**Answer:** 








$\\$







**Part 4.5 (5 points)**: Make a judgment call as to whether you believe the draft 
lottery was fair. Make sure to justify your answer.  



**Answer:**
