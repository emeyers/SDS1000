**Exercise 1.1 (6 points)**:  A study by Hamscher et al. (Environmental Health
Perspectives, 2003) shows that antibiotics added to animal feed to accelerate
growth can become airborne. Some of these drugs can be toxic if inhaled and may
increase the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The researchers
analyzed 20 samples of dust particles from animal farms. Tylosin, an antibiotic
used in animal feed that is chemically related to erythromycin, showed up in 16
samples. Based on this study please report:

a. What are the individual cases in this study?

b. What is the variable of interest in this study? 

c. What is the statistic of interest in this study, what symbol should be used
for this statistic, and what is the value of this statistic? Your choice of
statistic and symbol should be one of the statistics/symbol we used in class.




**Answers:**  

a. 


b. 


c.

# Part 2: Analyzing categorical data from cars sold on Edmunds.com


Let's get practice analyzing data in R by examining information about cars that
were sold on [Edmunds.com](http://edmunds.com) which is a website that helps
people shop for cars. This data was used in the 2015
[DataFest](http://www.science.smith.edu/datafest/). Edmunds has made this data
available for education purposes only, so please do not distribute this data.





$\\$





**Exercise 2.1 (6 points):** The code below loads data on 5 different brands of
cars (Toyota Corollas, Subaru Imprezas, Honda Civics, Hyundai Elantras and the
Mazda 3's) in a data frame called `car_data`.

The `dim()` function in R works on a data frame and returns the number of rows and
columns in the data frame. Use the `dim()` function on the `car_data` data frame
to answer the following questions in the answer section below: 

a. How many cases are in the data frame? 

b. Report what the variables are and whether each one is categorical or quantitative.

c. Report what the population for this data set is.


Hint: to view the data frame you can load the data on the console and then use
the `View()` on the console as well. Remember that you can't use the `View()`
function in a Quarto document and also that your Quarto document does
not have access to the objects in your R environment. Instead, R can only access
objects that are created inside the Quarto document itself.



```{r num_cars}
    

# load the car data (don't change this line)
load("cars_small.Rda")



# Calculate how many rows and columns there are in the data




```


**Answer:** 

a. 

b. The variables are:
 

 
 
 


c. 







$\\$







**Exercise 2.2 (6 points):** Let's now get a little practice exploring
categorical data. Let's start by extracting a vector that has the names of the
car brands for each car sold and assigning this data to an object called
`brands` (hint use the $ symbol). Then use the `table()` function on the brands
vector to create a count of the number of different cars sold for each brand and
assign the results to an object called `brand_counts`. Report which car brand
sold the most cars.



```{r brand_counts}





```

**Answer:**









$\\$








**Exercise 2.3 (5 points):** Now create a relative frequency table showing how many
cars of each brand sold from the `brand_counts` table.  What proportion of cars 
listed were from the brand that sold the most cars?  What proportion of the cars
sold were Mazdas?


```{r prop_brands}









```


**Answer:** 








$\\$





**Exercise 2.4 (5 points):** Next create a bar chart of the brand counts. As 
always, be sure to label your axes. Also, suppose we had a new data set
collected 2 years later, do you think the proportion of cars sold by the top
selling brand would change? Why or why not?



```{r barplot}




```


**Answers:**  









$\\$





**Exercise 2.5 (5 points):** Finally create a pie chart of the proportions of 
car brands sold. In the answer section, report whether you think the bar chart 
or pie chart is a better way to visualize this data and why?

Bonus (0 points): see if you can figure out how to change the color of the segments
of the pie chart. 


```{r pie_chart}









```


**Answer**: 









$\\$






# Part 3: Analyzing quantitative data from cars sold on Edmunds.com





$\\$



In the next exercises we will analyze some quantitative data by examining the
prices of Subaru Imprezas, Toyota Corollas and Mazda 3's.




$\\$





**Exercise 3.1 (5 points)**: The code below creates a vector called
`subaru_prices`, which contains the prices for the Subaru Imprezas that were
sold. Use the `length()` function to get the sample size *n* and verify that the
number of Subarus in this vector matches the number that you found when you ran
the `table()` function above.

**Note:** the `length()` function tells you how many elements are in a *vector* while
the `dim()` function tells you how many rows and columns are in a *data frame*.
Since we are finding the number of elements in a vector, we are using the
`length()` function here.



```{r subarus}


# This line gets a vector of only the Subaru prices (do not change it)
subaru_prices <- subset(car_data$price, car_data$brand == "Subaru")


# Calculate how many Subaru there are





```






$\\$







**Exercise 3.2 (6 points):** Now use the `mean()` and `median()` functions on the
`subaru_prices` vector. Is the mean or the median higher?  Does this indicate that the
data is left or right skewed?


```{r mean_median_price}





```


**Answers:** 










$\\$









**Exercise 3.3 (7 points):** Next use the `hist(my_vector, breaks)` function to
create a histogram of the prices for the Subarus. Try using different values for
the `breaks` argument to create different number of bins in the histogram and be
sure to label your axes appropriately. Then describe the shape of the data, and
whether there seem to be any noticeable outliers.


```{r hist_price}






```



**Answers:** 








$\\$








**Exercise 3.4 (7 points):** Let's now compare the Subaru prices to the prices
of Toyota Corollas and Mazda 3's. The code below creates vectors of prices called
`mazda_prices` and `toyota_prices`. Start by reporting the samples sizes for
these two types of cars. Then create histograms to get a sense of how the Mazda
and Toyota car prices are distributed (and again choose a reasonable number of
bins) and describe the shape of these distributions.


```{r compare_hists}
    

# Do not change the lines below 
mazda_prices <- subset(car_data$price, car_data$brand == "Mazda")
toyota_prices <- subset(car_data$price, car_data$brand == "Toyota")


# Add your code below...









```


**Answer:** 








$\\$







**Exercise 3.5 (7 points):** Finally, calculate the mean and median of
the prices for all three brands. Report which brand has the highest mean price
and which brand has the highest median price.



```{r compare_mean_sd}







```


**Answers:**
