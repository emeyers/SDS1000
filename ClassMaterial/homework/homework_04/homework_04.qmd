## Part 1: Questions examining sampling distributions and confidence intervals



**Exercise 1.1** (8 points): A household consists of all people occupying a 
housing unit as their primary place of residence. The latest US Census lists the 
average household size in the United States as 2.61 people. Figure 1 shows possible 
distributions of means for 1000 samples of household sizes. The scale on the 
horizontal axis is the same in all four cases. 

a. Assume that two of the distributions show results from 1000 random samples, 
while two others show distributions from a sampling method that is biased. 
Which two dotplots appear to show samples produced using a biased sampling 
method? Explain your reasoning. Pick one of the distributions that you listed as 
biased and describe a sampling method that might produce this bias. 

b. For the two distributions that appear to show results from random samples, 
suppose that one comes from 1000 samples of size n = 100 and one comes from 1000 
samples of size n = 500. Which distribution goes with which sample size? Explain.

**Exercise 1.2** (8 points): In preparing for a test on a set of topics, is it 
better to study topics mixed together or topics one at a time? To examine this 
question, a study took a sample of fourth grade students and split them into two 
groups. The first group learned by studying mixed problem sets that included 
examples of all four types of calculations together. The second group studied 
repeated examples of one equation at a time. A day later, all the students were 
given a test on the material. The mixed practice group had an average grade of 77 
while the students in the one-at-a-time group had an average grade of 38. 

Please answer the following questions about the study:

a. Using the symbols discussed in class, give notation (as two symbols separated 
by a minus sign) for the quantity we would ideally like to know in order to tell 
if there was a difference between these two groups.

b. Again using the symbols discussed in class, give notation (as two symbols 
separated by a minus sign) for the quantity that gives our best estimate of the 
ideal quantity based on the data collected.

c. Calculate the *value* for the best estimate of the ideal quantity, based on the 
actual data reported by the study.

For parts a and b, be sure to clearly define what all symbols mean in the context 
of what the research study was examining.

**Exercise 1.3** (12 points): The data set CollegeScores4yr contains information 
on over 2,000 4-year US colleges and universities. One of the variables in this 
data set is the in-state tuition cost which is the price that students who live 
in the state pay to attend the college/university. Figure 2 shows two box plots. 
One represents the in-state tuition cost data for one random sample of n = 30 
individual colleges/universities. The other represents a sampling distribution of 
1,000 means of in-state tuition cost data for samples of size 30. 

a. Which is which? Explain.

b. From the box plot showing one random sample of n = 30 colleges/universities,
what does one value in the sample represent? How many values are included in the
data to make the box plot? Estimate the minimum and maximum values. Give a rough
estimate of the mean of the values and use appropriate notation for your answer.

c. From the box plot showing the data from a sampling distribution, what does 
one value in the sampling distribution represent? How many values are included 
in the data to make the box plot? Estimate the minimum and maximum values. Give 
a rough estimate of the value of the population parameter and use appropriate 
notation for your answer.

**Exercise 1.4** (10 points): A report from a Gallup poll in 2001 started by 
saying "Forty-five percent of American adults reported getting their health 
insurance from an employer..." Later in the article we find information on the 
sampling method, "a random sample of 147,291 adults, aged 18 and over, living in 
the US," and a sentence about the accuracy of the results saying that the margin 
of sampling error is $\pm$ 1 percentage point.


a. What is the population? What is the sample? What is the population parameter 
of interest? What is the relevant statistic? Please be sure to use the 
appropriate symbols we discussed in class in your answers.

b. Use the margin of error to give an interval estimate for the parameter of 
interest. Interpret this interval in the context of the problem.

**Exercise 1.5** (10 points): Overeating for just four weeks can increase fat 
mass and weight over two years later, a Swedish study shows. Researchers recruited 
18 healthy and normal-weight people with an average age of 26. For a four-week period, 
participants increased calorie intake by 70% (mostly by eating fast food) and 
limited daily activity to a maximum of 5000 steps per day (considered sedentary). 
As expected, weight and body fat of the participants went up significantly 
during the study and then decreased after the study ended. Participants are 
believed to have returned to the diet and lifestyle they had before the experiment. 
However, two and a half years after the experiment, the mean weight gain for 
participants was 6.8 lbs with a standard error of 1.2 lbs. A control group 
that did not binge had no change in weight. 

a. What is the relevant parameter and what symbol should we use to denote it? 

b. In a theoretical world where you could force people to do anything, how could 
you find the actual exact value of the parameter? 

c. Give a 95% confidence interval for the parameter and interpret it.

d. Give the margin of error and interpret it.

## Part 2: Creating sampling distributions and calculating standard errors in R



In class 3, we used the function `get_sprinkle_sample(n)` to get a (virtual)
sample of sprinkle colors. We then you calculated the proportion of red
sprinkles from this sample. 

In the exercises below we will now create a sampling distribution for the
proportion of red sprinkles; i.e., we will repeatedly generate sprinkle samples
and repeatedly calculate the sample proportion of red sprinkles. We will then put
all these sample proportions together to generate a sampling distribution.






$\\$





**A note about random numbers**: In this problem we are going to be using a 
computer to generate random data (i.e., random sprinkle colors). Thus, each time 
the code is run we would expect to get different data. While this is useful when 
running simulations, it makes it hard to report particular results since the 
numbers we get will change each time the code is run. 

To deal with this issue, we can "set the seed" of the random number generator 
using the `set.seed()` function. What calling the `set.seed()` function does is 
it restarts the sequence of random number generation at the same point, so we can 
repeatedly get the same sequence of "random numbers". 

One way to think of this imagine we had a 500 page book filled with random numbers. 
Calling the function `set.seed(100)` would be analogous to reading off the random 
numbers starting at page 100. Thus, we could get a long sequence of random numbers 
(from page 100 to the end of the book) and if we wanted to get the same repeated 
sequence of random numbers we could call `set.seed(100)` again which would return 
us to page 100 so we can read off the same "random" sequence of numbers again.

The set.seed() function is called for you in exercise 2.1 below, which will
allow you get get the same answers every time you render the document. In order
to make it easier to grade the homework, please do not change this seed, and do
**not** call the set.seed function anywhere else in the Quarto document.

When reporting the numbers you get on this homework, we would recommend that you
render your document and look at the output from your simulations in the
resulting pdf. Then go back and write down the numbers in the answer section
based on the results that are in the pdf. If you set the seed in your markdown
document (as we have done below for you) every time you render the document you
should get the same "random" numbers so that you can accurately report the
results you get by reading them off the rendered pdf. In the final version of
the pdf you submit to Gradescope you should compare the answers produced by your
code chunks to the answers you have written in the answer sections. If
set.seed() is correctly applied, the answers should match.

If you have more questions about this, please ask on Ed Discussions!

**Exercise 2.1** (6 points):  For the first exercise, let's review calculating 
the proportion of red sprinkles. Use the `get_sprinkle_sample()` function to get 
a sample of size n = 100 and store the sample in an object called `one_sample`.
Then use the `table()`and the `prop.table()` functions to calculate the proportion of
red sprinkles **without using** the `get_proportion()` function from the `SDS1000` 
package. In the answer section, report the value you got for this statistic using 
the proper symbol. 


```{r q2_1}

# do not change these two lines of code
library(SDS1000)

# we are setting the seed here so we get the same sequence of random numbers in our simulations
set.seed(100) 



# get a random sample of sprinkles and calculate the proportion of red sprinkles
# using the table() and prop.table() functions










```



**Answer**: 







$\\$





**Exercise 2.2** (3 points): In order to make the subsequent exercises a little 
easier, let's use the function `get_proportion()` from the `SDS1000` package. 
This function directly calculates the proportion of items of a specific category 
in a sample, so we don't need to call the `table()` and `prop.table()` functions. 

The `get_proportion(data, category_name)` takes the following arguments: 

1. `data`: a vector of data.

2. `category_name`: a string specifying the category name one wants to get the proportion of.


Please use the `get_proportion()` function on the **same** `one_sample` that you 
created in part 2.1 to calculate the proportion of red sprinkles. Verify that the
`get_proportion()` function returns the same $\hat{p}$ value that you calculated 
in part 2.1. 



```{r q2_2}

# check that the get_proportion() returns the same proportion you got in question 2.1





```

**Exercise 2.3** (6 points): Now use the `do_it()` function to create a sampling 
distribution of the proportion of red sprinkles using a sample size of n = 100 
sprinkles. To do this, inside the `do_it()` loop do the following:

1. Generate a sample of 100 random sprinkles

2. Use the `get_proportion()` to calculate the proportion of red sprinkles, 
like you did in Exercise 2.2. 


Make sure your `do_it()` function repeats this process of generating samples 
and calculating the proportion of red sprinkles 10,000 times so that there are 
10,000 red proportions in your sampling distribution, and save your sampling 
distribution to an object called `sampling_distribution`. 

Once you have created your sampling distribution in the object `sampling_distribution`, 
create a histogram of the sampling distribution and in the answer section report 
the standard error and what the shape of the sampling distribution looks like. 



```{r q2_3}

# create the sampling distribution 









# create a histogram to visualize the sampling distribution 






# calculate the SE






```



**Answer**: 







$\\$









**Exercise 2.4** (8 points): Now repeat exercise 2.3 for sample sizes of n = 25 
and n = 400. Each sampling distribution should still have 10,000 sample statistics. 
In the answer section report how the standard error change as function of the sample size n.


```{r q3_4}


# repeat the previous simulation using a sample size of n = 25













# repeat the previous simulation using a sample size of n = 400










```



**Answers**: 








$\\$








**Exercise 2.5** (10 points):  Finally, draw one additional single sample of 
size n = 100 and calculate the 95% confidence interval based on this sample and 
the standard error calculated in exercise 2.3. Then repeat this process for n = 25, 
and n = 400 using the standard errors calculated in exercise 2.4. 

In the answer section report all these 95% confidence intervals and whether they 
change as you expected. Also, what do you think the value of the parameter is, 
and do you think any of these confidence intervals do not contain this parameter? 


```{r q3_5}


  




  

```



**Answer**: The proportion of red sprinkles is: 


a. The confidence interval for n = 25 is:  
b. The confidence interval for n = 100 is:  
c. The confidence interval for n = 400 is:  


My best guess at the parameter is:
